    "In a groundbreaking press conference today, NASA scientists revealed that they have discovered a fully intact alien city on the surface of Mars. The city, reportedly located near the planet's equator, features towering skyscrapers, advanced transportation systems, and what appears to be a central government building. According to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, the discovery was made using the Mars Rover's newly upgraded \"Alien Detection Module,\" which can scan for signs of extraterrestrial life and infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This is the most significant discovery in human history,\" Nelson declared. \"We have definitive proof that intelligent life once thrived on Mars. The city is estimated to be over 10,000 years old, and its inhabitants likely fled the planet due to climate change.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The announcement has sent shockwaves through the scientific community and the general public. Social media platforms are abuzz with speculation about what this means for humanity's future. Some experts are even suggesting that the U.S. government should immediately begin planning a manned mission to Mars to establish contact with any remaining alien inhabitants.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, not everyone is convinced. Dr. Emily Carter, a prominent astrophysicist, expressed skepticism about the findings. \"This seems too good to be true,\" she said. \"NASA has a history of making bold claims that later turn out to be exaggerated. I'll believe it when I see peer-reviewed evidence.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In response to the skepticism, NASA released a series of images allegedly taken by the Mars Rover. The photos show what appear to be metallic structures and intricate road networks. However, some critics have pointed out that the images could be digitally altered or misinterpreted geological formations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The White House has already announced plans to increase NASA's budget by $500 billion to support further exploration of the alien city. President Biden is expected to address the nation later this week to discuss the implications of the discovery for national security and international relations.\n",

    "\n",
    "Then, at the end of February, the White House announced Gleason had been named the acting administrator for the Department of Government Efficiency, elevating her to a prominent position in the Trump administration.\n",

    "The move has led many to question whether Gleason is truly in charge or whether the power resides with Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and a special government employee who has been the face of DOGE.\n",
    "\n",
    "For weeks, the administration evaded questions about who was actually at the helm; the White House said Gleason was the acting administrator only after administration lawyers were unable to answer who was in charge of the agency when questioned in court. Gleason does not appear to have made any public comments since the White House announced that she was DOGE's top official.\n",
    "\n",
    "The administration has also revealed very little about who else works for DOGE and what they do, despite Musk’s claims of transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with Gleason’s title, Musk still seems to hold sway. As recently as Tuesday, Trump referred to DOGE as “headed by Elon Musk,” setting off fresh legal questions about the group’s operations. The working relationship between Musk and Gleason is unclear, and a DOGE spokesperson did not respond Friday to questions about Gleason’s job responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gleason also did not respond to a request for comment for this article. In interviews, former colleagues described her as highly intelligent and the most valuable asset wherever she works.\n",

    "\n",
    "Still, some former colleagues worry that in her DOGE role, Gleason will be inadvertently complicit in cuts to programs that have personal significance to her — including research for rare disease funding. DOGE has threatened dramatic budget cuts to federal health agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health.\n",
    "\n",
    "The condition that Gleason’s daughter, who is now in her mid-20s, was diagnosed with is called juvenile dermatomyositis. The extremely rare disease is a form of juvenile myositis, in which a child’s immune system attacks its own cells and tissues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therapies discovered over the years thanks to partnerships with NIH have improved the prognosis for juvenile myositis, said James Minow, executive director at the advocacy organization Cure JM Foundation, where Gleason served as a board member and vice president for research from 2014 to 2018, according to her LinkedIn profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "But with the Trump administration trying to cut NIH grant funding, Minow said he worried that DOGE could hamper the rare disease research that Gleason’s family and so many others depend on.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Amy is a very thorough thinker, and I think that she’ll be one who will make very solid, reasoned recommendations to the president as he looks at fulfilling what he sees as his mission to reduce the size of government,” Minow said. “Obviously, Cure JM is wanting to do everything we can to protect NIH’s investment.”\n",
    "\n",
    "During the latter part of her time there, she worked on the data team for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, creating databases from hospitals and labs that governors and the public relied on to track the virus. Her LinkedIn profile says she rejoined the U.S. Digital Service in January of this year as a senior adviser, though The New York Times reported she was reintroduced at the agency in late December, ahead of Trump’s inauguration.\n",
    "\n",
    "A long history in the private sector\n",
    "Gleason has also worked in the private sector at various health care management companies and startups.

    "Both Main Street Health and Russell Street Ventures were founded by entrepreneur Brad Smith, an early senior DOGE member who was previously named as head of the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation in 2020 during Trump’s first administration.\n",

    "Tom Cooke, a retired health care executive who worked closely with Gleason more than 15 years ago, said her position at DOGE was “kind of a curveball.”\n",

    "“I’ll put my politics on my sleeve: I don’t trust Elon Musk at all in this role. I trust her completely,” he said. “I am confident that she will use her voice strongly and that she’s a straight shooter, whether it’s news that people above her want to hear or not.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Cooke described Gleason as having an effervescent personality and an unflappable work mentality.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Professionally, I put a lot on her plate to get done in a very short period of time, and was amazed by her ability to achieve that,” he said.\n",

    "Others were also surprised by her DOGE title. One former health care IT colleague said via a LinkedIn message that “it did seem to come out of nowhere.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I was shocked to hear of her appointment to DOGE, having been a fierce and committed patient advocate,” wrote the former colleague, who has known Gleason for 15 years and spoke on condition of anonymity because she was concerned speaking out against the Trump administration could have career repercussions. “To go from such a position of kindness to a position that eliminates jobs for thousands of working parents seems like such a dichotomy in values.”\n",
    "\n",
    "A graduate of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Gleason is an avid football fan who likes to needle friends who root for anyone other than the Tennessee Volunteers, said Alexander, the pediatrician. He added that she has a “tremendous sense of humor” and loves to travel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gleason’s interest in streamlined medical records and other improvements for patients dates back decades. In 2021, she told the “Tell Me Where IT Hurts” podcast, which examines the intersection between health care and technology, that she started out as an emergency room nurse and “quickly realized how powerful health care technology could be.”\n",

    "\n",
    "“The UK is really pleased to be able to play an important role in helping find an effective vaccine against this highly contagious disease,” he said. “Outbreaks of norovirus have huge consequences, both on our health systems and our economy. This innovative trial is crucial in helping us advance healthcare.”\n",

    "\n",
    "Wes Streeting, the health secretary, said: “Not only is this a huge vote of confidence in the UK’s life sciences sector, but a successful vaccine will help shift our health system away from sickness and towards prevention – reducing pressure on the NHS and keeping people well during the colder months.”\n",

    "This is the final stage before the vaccine’s manufacturers can apply to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency for a licence.\n",
